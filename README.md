SNHU CS 305 Module Eight Journal

Artemis Financial is a financial advisory company. They want a program that can bring their services online, allowing them to work with their clients with their savings, retirements, investments, and insurance.
I focused heavily on encryption and ensuring that the system Artemis Financial would be using would be secure for them and their users financial information. Having strong security protects the clients and the company from losing any sensitive information.
Having the vulnerability assessment can be daunting as it is a lot of information to take in at times, but having all issues laid out helps you take it step by step covering all bases.
I increased layers of security through using large bitkeys and assymmetrical keys for security, preventing interception or brute force.
Through copious amounts of testing and use of automated testing I was able to ensure that any errors or weakenesses present were repaired and handled.
The main resource that was used was a dependency check, which scans the program and finds any security weakenesses.
Of course the document I have provided entails a detailed list of my work on this project and showcases my strongsuits and my room for improvement. Even if I have a weakness in my technique I am willing to work to improve.
